        <br/>
        <p><strong>What personally identifiable information does planbook.com collect from me?</strong></p>
        <p>Planbook.com believes that as little personal information as possible should be collected from our users. The personal information we collect for planbook.com is contained on the User Settings page, and the only required item is your email address. </p>
        <p>In addition to the information we collect on the User Settings page, we may ask you for personal information at other times, such as when you contact our support team. Furthermore, when you send e-mail or other communication to planbook.com, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests, and improve our services.</p>
        <br/>
        <p><strong>What are cookies and how does planbook.com use them?</strong></p>
        <p>As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, planbook.com may use cookies to temporarily store information about you. A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that uniquely identifies your browser. We may use cookies to better display our website, to save you time, and to provide better technical support. </p>
        <p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some planbook.com features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.</p>
        <br/>
        <p><strong>How does planbook.com use my information?</strong></p>
        <p>Our goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our site and a high level of user support. </p>
        <p>Planbook.com does research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration, from our server log files, or from surveys. We do this to better understand and serve our users; for instance, this information often gives us ideas for improving our products. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. </p>
        <br/>
        <p><strong>Who is collecting information?</strong></p>
        <p>When you are on planbook.com and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with planbook.com alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise.
