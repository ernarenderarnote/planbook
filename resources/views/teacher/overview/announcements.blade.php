         <h4>Student Announcements</h4>
        <p>The Student Announcements button provides you with a simple method to communicate with your students and parents. It is used in combination with the Sharing feature (covered later in this overview) such that when you share your plans with your students, they will also be able to view any information you place in Student Announcements.
	   </p>
	   <p>Student Announcements are not tied to a specific day or week, and your students will be able to view this information until you update or remove it. You can use Student Announcements to remind students of important upcoming events, assignment due dates, materials to bring to class, etc.
