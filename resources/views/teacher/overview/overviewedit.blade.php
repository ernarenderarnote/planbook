         <h4>Add or Edit Lessons</h4>
        <p>Perhaps the first thing you'll want to know is how to add or edit lessons in your plans. To add or edit a lesson, you can either single click on    the lesson title (class name), or double click anywhere on the lesson.
	   </p>
         <p>You can also use the action arrow in the upper right corner of each lesson to edit, copy/paste, bump (move to next day), extend (copy to next day) or delete your lesson.</p>
         <p>Note that before you add lessons, you'll want to create your classes (the subjects you teach). Your first class was automatically added when you created your planbook.com account, and we'll show you how to add additional classes later in this overview.</p>
