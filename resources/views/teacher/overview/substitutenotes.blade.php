         <h4>Substitute Notes</h4>
        <p>The Substitute Notes button provides you with a place to store general classroom information that would be helpful to a substitute teacher. This may include a list of students with special needs, classroom rules, bathroom procedures, transition activities, who to contact with questions, etc.
	   </p>
	   <p>When you will have a substitute teacher for your class, you can simply print out your daily lesson plans, print out your Substitute Notes, and leave them on your desk. You can also save your plans and notes to a PDF file, and send them via email if you are not able to return to your classroom.
